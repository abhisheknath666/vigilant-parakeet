- What intrigues you about philosophy?

As many of us are, I’m naturally inquisitive and skeptical. I would like to know for instance if my gold fish genuinely spontaneously dematerialized or whether that was simply a cunning explanation for an unfortunate incident involving a cat, a healthy gold fish and my narcoleptic cat sitter. To decipher these truths I find that the scientific method is quite an excellent tool. However science is limited by an elaborate, time consuming process and amongst other things proper funding(which implies political lobbying) . As a result it’s not always possible to find scientifically acceptable answers in the timeframe of our lives.

Moreover the impact of any scientific finding as it is pertinent to my life usually exists outside of the realm of science. It falls squarely in the realm of philosophy. Philosophy allows us to use intuition as a navigator to reach rational explanations for these topics that are beyond the reach of the scientific process. As such it has become the ultimate intellectual tool to understand our universe and its significance.

- What about the spiritual process?

The spiritual process for me is borne of trying to live consciously. We can readily provide a rational explanation for any daily mundane action; why did I turn the television off? Because if I have to hear that brittany spears number one more time I might be inclined to off a lot more than a television set. But I can’t quite easily answer the question of why I woke up this morning? Or whether it was even me that woke up this morning? Or why everyone is always upset with everyone else? What does it all mean? These questions don’t have an obvious immediate reasoning.

But without having answers to those questions, how do I honestly know what to make an impact on? What do I need to accomplish before I die? Or much simpler why should I even choose one job over another? I either have to provide myself with reasonable lies or choose to forgo conscious decision making for these bigger questions. Neither one is acceptable to me so my only real option is to climb the gangly web of spirituality. Make no mistake; it is an intricate web with as many strands as we have open questions. And you might only find your way into the chasm of some wandering spider. But since it is the only option, I’ve decided to take it.
